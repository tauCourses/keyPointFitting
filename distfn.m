function [inliers, M] = distfn( input_args )
%     distfn    - Handle to a function that evaluates the
%                 distances from the model to data x.
%                 It is assumed that the function is of the form:
%                    [inliers, M] = distfn(M, x, t)
%                 This function must evaluate the distances between points
%                 and the model returning the indices of elements in x that
%                 are inliers, that is, the points that are within distance
%                 't' of the model.  Additionally, if M is a cell array of
%                 possible models 'distfn' will return the model that has the
%                 most inliers.  If there is only one model this function
%                 must still copy the model to the output.  After this call M
%                 will be a non-cell object representing only one model.
