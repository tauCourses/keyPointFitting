function [M] = fittingfn(x)
%     fittingfn - Handle to a function that fits a model to s
%                 data from x.  It is assumed that the function is of the
%                 form: 
%                    M = fittingfn(x)
%                 Note it is possible that the fitting function can return
%                 multiple models (for example up to 3 fundamental matrices
%                 can be fitted to 7 matched points).  In this case it is
%                 assumed that the fitting function returns a cell array of
%                 models.
%                 If this function cannot fit a model it should return M as
%                 an empty matrix.
    M = DLT(x');
